Though I could easily charge a moderate sum of money for each plan, or upwards of $150 for the complete set of finished plans, I am giving this project's plans and files away on this GitHub for free. 

The Flight Simulation Community has given me so much and I would like to give back. Free C172 Plans were what started me off in flight simulation when I was younger, and I don't want cost to be an obstacle for any young aspiring individuals to build their very own Cessna 172 Flight Sim.

If you are just getting started in Flight Simulation: I believe in you. You can do this. It will take time and hard work, but for me it is definitely worth it.
