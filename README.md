# The-Cessna-172-Project-V3
These plans are based on a "Pay What You Want" model. Though I could charge money for these plans, I want to give this project's plans and files away on this GitHub for free.

The Flight Simulation Community has given me so much and I would like to give back. Free C172 Plans were what started me off in flight simulation when I was younger, and I don't want cost to be an obstacle for any young aspiring individuals to build their very own Cessna 172 Flight Sim.

If you are just getting started in Flight Simulation: I believe in you. You can do this. It will take time and hard work, but for me it is definitely worth it, and you might find it is too.
